I was watching a youtube playlist and wanted to find out how long it would take me to finish the playlist - I realised there wasn't really an efficient way of adding up the video durations. I tried using my calculator on my phone but I would have to add up the minutes and seconds separately, plus I kept forgetting which video duration I was up to in the playlist. I've realised that you could easily do this in excel or google sheets, but I thought this would be a fun exercise to use some of the Ruby concepts I've been learning.
